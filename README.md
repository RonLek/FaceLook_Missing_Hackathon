# ðŸ¤– FaceLook

The aim of this project is to build a facial recognition app that can recognize faces using any phone's camera for potential victims. Most of the times if anyone comes across someone who is missing they don't carry a directory of missing persons with them, but almost everyone carries their phone! The quickest way to verify a possible victim for a Samaritan or an official would be to scan the face of the person they encounter to check if that person is one of the people missing. This app serves to provide this functionality.

The app would use state-of-the-art machine learning and computer vision algorithms to check for a scanned face through its database of missing persons and once verified it will connect the user to the officials and simultaneously share the GPS location of the user at the time the face-scan was performed in case of a match. The user can then also fill in additional details like the condition of the victim, nature of the people accompanying them, etc. This app would highly benefit not only the law enforcement officials but also act as a tool for citizens to report valuable details to the authorities.
